                <p>Welcome to the Bharat Seva+ Healthcare Dashboard! Weâ€™re thrilled to have you explore our platform. Use the side panel to navigate through the available features and tools.</p>
                <p>
                    Our primary focus is on developing a highly scalable and fast backend that drives the platform with advanced features. While the frontend offers a user-friendly interface, the backend powers the system with robust and efficient functionality to meet your needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Weâ€™re also working on integrating a cutting-edge deep learning model to revolutionize how healthcare data is processed and insights are delivered. This feature is still under development and promises to bring innovative enhancements to the platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your feedback is invaluable to us. As an early user, your insights will help us refine the platform further. If youâ€™d like to contribute to the project, feel free to reach out or explore our repositories to get involved!
